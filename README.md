# Internship

The goal of this project was to enhance the clarity and readability of these scanned invoices by implementing and analyzing various denoising techniques. We explored a wide range of methods, including traditional approaches like Gaussian and Median filtering, advanced algorithms such as Non-Local Means and Anisotropic Diffusion, and machine learning methods like Autoencoders.

The performance of these techniques was assessed with OCR accuracy, which was used to gauge the practical impact of these methods on text extraction. Among the implemented approaches, combinations of Anisotropic Diffusion, Gaussian Blur, and Non-Local Means proved to be the most effective for balancing noise reduction and preserving text clarity.

To demonstrate the practical application, We developed a user-friendly Streamlit application. This tool enables users to upload scanned invoices, apply different denoising methods, and compare results based on OCR accuracy, making it a robust solution for real-world document processing.

This project provided valuable insights into image preprocessing and advanced denoising techniques, offering practical implications for broader document automation workflows.
